# Flight Data
## Project By Abdelrahman

## Project Overview

> This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The primary goal was to systematically explore a dataset using Python's visualization libraries. The analysis process began with examining individual variables, followed by bivariate and multivariate analysis to uncover deeper insights.

> The findings were then summarized and presented in a concise manner using explanatory data analysis techniques. A slide deck was created to outline the key exploration steps and findings, weaving a narrative to help the audience understand the discoveries made throughout the analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project was chosen from the list provided by Udacity. It is the **Flights Dataset**, which contains flight performance metrics within the United States. The data spans 1987 to 2022 and was sourced from the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**.
